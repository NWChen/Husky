Built in a college dorm room, the T-Shirt Shooting Robot is a 100-pound robot that shoots t-shirts into crowds using two counter-rotating flywheels. Its six-chambered electric shooter sits atop three omnidirectional drive modules, which allow it to drive around while controlled remotely via mobile phone.

As makers, we (Jan and Neil) are interested in working on projects that inspire people to build bigger and better. To that end, we have ve packed the T-Shirt Shooting Robot with plenty of features, including:

/// Automatically revolving shooter, to fire up to six shirts at a time
/// Computer vision to recognize and move towards human faces
/// Custom mobile interface and Flask webserver, to communicate remotely with a human operator (who could be you, this year at Maker Faire New York!)
/// Adjustable shooter angle via a custom linear actuator
/// Lasercut and 3D-printed construction, thanks to the Columbia MakerSpace.

We look forward to demonstrating our work at Maker Faire, and to seeing you at our booth!

I study Electrical Engineering at the Grove School of Engineering (CCNY). Biomedical technology is an intense interest of mine; as a result, we tried to imbue animal-inspired motion in the T-Shirt Shooting Robot by building an omnidirectional drive platform. This means the robot is able to translate and rotate in all directions, just like a person can. I look forward to meeting you at Maker Faire New York this October!
